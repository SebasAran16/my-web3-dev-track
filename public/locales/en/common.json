      "1": "I am Sebastian Zambrano Arango, I have always been very curious and an enthusiast about technology. That lead me to discover Blockchain on 2021 and since then start learning about how the technology works, and as I loved it's capabilities and functionalities, I decided I will dedicate to it.",
      "2": "With an school background of C language, I started learning Solidity on my own with all the resources that there are out there, completed several courses and realized I needed to learn more than Solidity if I wanted to dedicate to it, it was there when I learned about security and optimization in Solidity and more Languages and tools for being a Web3 Fullstack Developer such as Javascript and React with NextJs. And for testing all what I have learned I am building a protocol on my own which is in it's MVP phase right now.",
      "3": "Lately I have been paying attention to AIs and figuring out how to use them in my daily study and coding sessions to improve my efficiency."
